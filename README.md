# Link-State-Routing-Protocol-Simulator
This program simulates the Link State Routing Algorithm using CSV files representing the topology of the network, changes to be made to the topology, and messages to be delivered over the network.
It generates an output text file showing the all of the routes taken for the messages and the updated routes after the changes made to the topology, along with the cost of each hop taken.
The purpose of this is to illustrate how the Link State Protocol functions in data transmission across networks.
